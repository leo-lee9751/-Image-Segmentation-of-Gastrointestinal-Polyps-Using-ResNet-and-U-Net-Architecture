# -Image-Segmentation-of-Gastrointestinal-Polyps-Using-ResNet-and-U-Net-Architecture
Currently, colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, with it contributing to over 10% of all cancers. This convolutional neural network model, trained on an annotated medical dataset(KVAIR-SEG), is able to accurately detect gastrointestinal polyps with a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.8%.
